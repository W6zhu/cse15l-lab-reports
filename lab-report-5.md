Hi, <br> 
I'm trying to run my auto grader, but I ran into this error with what appears to be my JUnit. I have a feeling it may be how I wrote the code to start JUnit in line 28. I've attached my code and the error from the terminal below.

Hi, <br>
Based on the output in your terminal it appears that your error may be at one of the `cp` lines. Based on this what information provides, what can we try to do to fix the bug? <br>

In the second half of the quarter, I certainly learned a lot in regards to the functions of VIM. While it was annoying to work with at first, I soon got the hang of it. I found it extremely useful to use VIM when I don't have access to a code editior like VS Code. It may not be as nice or user friendly as visual studio code is, but it got the job done.
