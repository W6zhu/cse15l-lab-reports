_cd no arguement_
* Working directory: Home/main
* Output: Got as expected for CD as it's used for changing directory and we didn't change the directory. Having no arguments means that nothing is being changed here.
* Error?: The output was not an error as we did not change the directory.

_ls no arguement_
* Working directory: Home/main
* Output: It showed what was in the home/main which was the folder `lecture1`. No arguments here showed us what files/folders were in the current directory.
* Error?: No error was thrown as the output was as expected.

_cat no arguement_
* Working directory: Home/main
* Output: There was no output, as there are no files to concatenate/print in the current directory. No arguments here threw the console into a spin, had to abort it using `Control + C`.
* Error?: The command threw the terminal into a spin, and had to abort using `Control + C`. It was trying to concatenate something that it couldn't.
